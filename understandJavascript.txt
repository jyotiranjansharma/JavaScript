Here are the key points:

- **High-Level Code to Machine Code:**
  - Understand the process of translating high-level JavaScript code into machine code and its execution as a stack frame on the call stack.

- **Memory and Primitive Types:**
  - Understand how different primitive types are stored in memory, including addresses, space allocation, and binary representation.
  - Recognize the concept of mantissa in floating-point representations.

- **Value Types vs. Reference Types:**
  - Differentiate between value types and reference types.
  - Understand the implications of assigning values vs. assigning pointers.

- **Typing Systems:**
  - Understand implicit typing, explicit typing, nominal typing, structural typing, and duck typing.

- **Comparison and Type Checking:**
  - Distinguish between `==`, `===`, and `typeof` in JavaScript.

- **Scopes:**
  - Understand function scope, block scope, and lexical scope.

- **Expressions and Statements:**
  - Differentiate between an expression and a statement.
  - Understand the concept of evaluating an expression.

- **Memory and Call Stack:**
  - Understand what happens in memory/on the call stack when evaluating expressions, passing arguments, returning results, and assigning or retrieving values.

- **IIFEâ€™s, Modules, and Namespaces:**
  - Understand Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE's), modules, and namespaces.
  - Recognize why ES6 modules and block scope don't fully replace IIFE's.

- **Event Loop and Message Queue:**
  - Understand how the message queue and event loop work in JavaScript, including timing, async behavior, 
  and handling browser APIs like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `requestAnimationFrame`.

- **Performance and Optimization:**
  - Identify more expensive operations in terms of processing time or memory.
  - Use tools like `jsperf` and `performance.now` for performance testing.
  - Understand Big O notation and its relevance.

- **JavaScript Engines:**
  - Understand optimizations (opts) and deoptimizations (deopts) across different JavaScript engines.

- **Number Representations:**
  - Represent numbers in binary, hex, decimal, and scientific notation in JavaScript and other languages.

- **Binary Data Manipulation:**
  - Understand bitwise operators, typed arrays, and array buffers.
  - Use RGBA as a context for manipulating binary data.

- **Object-Oriented Concepts:**
  - Understand `new`, constructors, `instanceof`, and instances.
  - Recognize prototypical inheritance, the prototype chain, and the limitations of classical inheritance in JavaScript.
  - Differentiate between `Object.create` and `Object.assign`.

- **Design Patterns and Inheritance:**
  - Understand the factory and class design patterns.
  - Differentiate between member properties and properties on the prototype.
  - Recognize the "is a" vs. "has a" relationships in inheritance and polymorphism.

- **Functional Programming Concepts:**
  - Understand pure functions, side effects, and state mutation.
  - Use `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` to replace for/while loops.
  - Understand lambdas, closures, higher-order functions, and their usage.

- **Abstract Data Structures:**
  - Understand abstract data structures, their implementation in JavaScript, and typical use cases.
  - Recognize the use of recursion in building abstract data structures.

- **Algorithm Familiarity:**
  - Be familiar with common algorithms and how to find the right one for specific problems.

- **Design Patterns:**
  - Become familiar with common design patterns and their applications in JavaScript.

- **Functional Techniques:**
  - Understand partial functions, currying, compose, and pipe.
  - Recognize the utility of unary functions.

- **Reflection in JavaScript:**
  - Understand how reflection works differently in JavaScript compared to strongly typed, compiled languages.
