// An anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that does not have a name. 
// It is often used for short-lived operations where you donâ€™t need to reference the function by name. 
// Anonymous functions are commonly used as arguments to other functions or for defining inline logic.

// ### Characteristics of Anonymous Functions:

// - **No Name**: As the name suggests, it lacks an explicit name.
// - **Often Used Inline**: Typically used where functions are needed temporarily or as arguments.
// - **Can Be Assigned to Variables**: Though anonymous, they can be assigned to variables, properties, or passed directly.

// ### Syntax and Examples:

// #### 1. **Basic Anonymous Function Expression**

// Anonymous functions can be assigned to variables:


const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
};

greet(); // Output: Hello, World!


// #### 2. **Anonymous Function as an Argument**

// Anonymous functions are often used as callbacks in functions:

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This will be logged after 1 second");
}, 1000);

// #### 3. **Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)**

// An IIFE is an anonymous function that is executed immediately after it is defined:

(function() {
  console.log("I am an IIFE and run immediately");
})();

// #### 4. **Arrow Functions**

// Arrow functions are a concise way to write anonymous functions. They do not have their own `this` context and are often used for their brevity:

const add = (a, b) => a + b;

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8

// ### Key Points:

// - **Function Expressions**: Anonymous functions are typically defined using function expressions, which can be immediately invoked or assigned to variables.
// - **Callback Functions**: They are often used as callback functions for asynchronous operations.
// - **Conciseness**: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax and are useful in scenarios where you need short, simple functions.

// ### Example with Event Listener:

document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
  alert("Button clicked!");
});

// In this example, an anonymous function is used as a callback for the `click` event of the button with the id `myButton`.

// Summary:

// Anonymous functions are versatile and useful for scenarios where functions are required temporarily or inline. 
// They help in keeping the code concise and focused, particularly in functional programming or event-driven scenarios.
